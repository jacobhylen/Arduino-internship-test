# Use LDRs to sense direction
### Introduction
An LDR, or light dependent resistor, has a dynamic resistance that changes depending on the amount of light that hits it. By connecting it to your arduino board of choice will let you measure brightness.  Connecting LDRs to your Arduino is very simple, yet their input can be used in many creative ways, and in this tutorial you will learn how you can take advantage of just two of these dynamic resistors to determine the direction from which an approaching object is coming.

### Materials
The materials you will need are as follows:
* Arduino Micro, this can be substituted with another model. 
* LDR (2 pc)
* LED (2 pc)
* 10k Resistor (4 pc)
* wires


### LDR
Light dependent resistors are not normally used in this way, and one could argue that they are not the best suited sensor. But their size and simplicity makes them very easy to work with, and with a little bit of creativity you can nearly invisibly mount them on or in an object to add functionality to it.
